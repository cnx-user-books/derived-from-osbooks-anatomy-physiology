<para id="eip-369">In an earlier section we discussed types of signal molecules. While the characteristics of the signal molecule are important for understanding how the molecule gets to the target cells and the ways it is able to interact with those cells, the actual response (interpretation) depends on the specific transduction pathways activated in the responding cell.  </para><para id="eip-190">Transduction pathways are the way in which target cells convert a signal (or message) into action. That action (response) is the target cell's <emphasis effect="italics">interpretation</emphasis> of the message. Just like different individuals may have vastly different interpretations of the same message, so different cell types often have different responses to the same signal molecule. The characteristics of the target cell determine the specific response to a signal molecule. The signal molecule can only turn the response that already exists in a specific target cell on or off. </para><para id="eip-106">In the chapter on <emphasis effect="italics">Energy and Metabolism</emphasis> we discussed characteristics of enzymes and substrates. The same binding principles are at play with all ligand/receptor interactions, including signal-molecule/receptor binding. So if you do not remember them, this would be a good time to review the concepts of <emphasis effect="italics">induced fit</emphasis> and <emphasis effect="italics">affinity</emphasis>. The receptor proteins that trigger different transduction pathways for the same signal molecule also often have slight differences in the receptor binding sites that affect the induced fit and affinity for the signal molecule. This can affect the whole body response to specific signals, but is particularly important in how certain drugs that act as agonists or antagonists for one of these responses can cause unwanted side effects (different responses) from other cells with similar receptors for the same signaling molecule.</para><section id="fs-id1850428">
<title>Activation Mechanisms and Modes of Action</title><para id="fs-id2278385">Ligands are either hydrophilic (polar) or hydrophobic (non-polar). Hydrophilic ligands cannot cross the non-polar interior of the plasma membrane, so they must bind to cell-surface receptors on the outside of the plasma membrane and effect their changes via the receptor protein. Because hydrophobic signal molecules can easily diffuse through the plasma membrane, they can attach to receptor proteins in the cytoplasm inside the cell. However, it is important to remember that just because a signal molecule <emphasis effect="italics">can</emphasis> activate internal receptors does not mean that all its receptors <emphasis effect="italics">are</emphasis> internal. Some hydrophobic signal molecules bind to cell-surface receptors as well as intracellular receptors in certain cells.

<title>Intracellular Receptors and Signal Transduction</title><para id="fs-id2235306"><term>Internal receptors</term>, also known as intracellular or cytoplasmic receptors, are found in the cytoplasm of the cell and respond to hydrophobic ligand molecules that are able to travel across the plasma membrane. Once inside the cell, many of these molecules bind to receptor sites on proteins that act as regulators of mRNA synthesis (transcription) to mediate gene expression. These are the transcription factors discussed in the earlier chapter: <emphasis effect="italics">DNA and Protein Synthesis</emphasis>. When the ligand binds to the internal receptor, a conformational change is triggered that exposes a DNA-binding site on the protein. The ligand-receptor complex moves into the nucleus, then binds to specific regulatory regions of the chromosomal DNA and promotes the initiation of transcription (<link target-id="fig-ch09_01_03" document=""/>).

<title>Cell-Surface Receptors and Signal Transduction</title><para id="fs-id1426300"><term>Cell-surface receptors</term>, also known as transmembrane receptors, are cell surface, membrane-anchored (integral) proteins that bind to hydrophilic ligand molecules on the external surface of the plasma membrane. This type of receptor spans the plasma membrane and performs signal transduction, in which an extracellular signal is converted into an intracellular signal and response. Ligands that interact with cell-surface receptors do not have to enter the cell that they affect. Cell-surface receptors are also called cell-specific proteins or markers because they are specific to individual cell types.</para><para id="fs-id2854117">Because cell-surface receptor proteins are fundamental to normal cell functioning, it should come as no surprise that a malfunction in any one of these proteins could have severe consequences.

<para id="fs-id1728096"><title>How Viruses Recognize a Host</title>Unlike living cells, many viruses do not have a plasma membrane or any of the structures necessary to copy themselves. Some viruses are simply composed of an inert protein shell surrounding DNA or RNA. To reproduce, viruses must invade a living cell, which serves as a host, and then take over the hosts cellular apparatus. But how does a virus recognize its host?</para><para id="fs-id2854013">Viruses often bind to cell-surface receptors on the host cell. For example, the virus that causes human influenza (flu) binds specifically to receptors on membranes of cells of the respiratory system. Chemical differences in the cell-surface receptors among hosts mean that a virus that infects a specific species (for example, humans) cannot infect another species (for example, chickens).</para>
<para id="fs-id1685167">However, viruses have very small amounts of DNA or RNA compared to humans, and, as a result, viral reproduction can occur rapidly. Viral reproduction invariably produces errors that can lead to changes in newly produced viruses; these changes mean that the viral proteins that interact with cell-surface receptors may evolve in such a way that they can bind to receptors in a new host. Such changes happen randomly and quite often in the reproductive cycle of a virus, but the changes only matter if a virus with new binding properties comes into contact with a suitable host. In the case of influenza, this situation can occur in settings where animals and people are in close contact, such as poultry and swine farms.<sup><footnote id="fn-ch09_01_01"><para id="eip-id1442926">A.

There are two general categories of cell-surface signal transduction based on the mechanism used to activate the transduction process. In <term>direct activation</term> (or <term>ligand activation</term>) the receptor and effector share the same protein, so the ligand directly activates the transduction process. With <term>indirect activation</term> the receptor is on one protein and the effector is on a different, physically separated, protein. This requires the proteins to communicate to activate the effector. The intermediate signal is a G-protein so this mechanism is also called <term>G-protein-linked activation</term>. There also are two modes of effector action: <term>channels</term> and <term>enzymes</term>. Therefore there are four possible combinations of activation types and modes of action, see (<link target-id="fig-Hydrophilic_Signal_Transduction" document=""/>).

When a ligand binds to the receptor the channel opens through the membrane allowing specific ions to pass through. To form a channel the protein has an extensive membrane-spanning region. In order to interact with the phospholipid fatty acid tails that form the center of the plasma membrane, many of the amino acids in the membrane-spanning region are hydrophobic in nature. Conversely, the amino acids that line the inside of the channel are hydrophilic to allow for the passage of water or ions. When a ligand binds to the extracellular region of the channel, there is a conformational change in the protein's structure that allows ions such as sodium, calcium, magnesium, and hydrogen to pass through (<link target-id="fig-ch09_01_04" document=""/>).</para><figure id="fig-ch09_01_04"><media id="fs-id1291437" alt="This illustration shows a gated ion channel that is closed in the absence of a signaling molecule.

Their mode of action is to open the channel rather than close it.</para><para id="eip-610"><term>Direct, Ligand-activated enzymes</term> are cell-surface receptors with intracellular domains that are associated with an enzyme. In some ligand-activated enzymes, the intracellular domain of the receptor protein itself is an enzyme. Other ligand-activated enzymes have a small intracellular domain that directly interacts with the enzyme. The ligand-activated enzymes normally have large extracellular and intracellular domains, but the membrane-spanning region consists of a single alpha-helical region of the peptide strand. When a ligand binds to the extracellular domain, a signal is transferred through the membrane, activating the enzyme. Activation of the enzyme sets off a chain of events within the cell that eventually leads to a response.  One example of this type of ligand-activated enzyme is the tyrosine kinase receptor protein (<link target-id="fig-ch09_01_07" document=""/>). A kinase is an enzyme that  transfers phosphate groups from ATP to another protein. When ligands bind to the tyrosine kinase receptor it results in the transfer of phosphate groups to the intracellular tyrosine molecules (tyrosine residues). First, signaling molecules bind to the extracellular domain of two nearby tyrosine kinase receptors. The two neighboring receptors then bond together, or dimerize. Phosphates are then added to tyrosine residues on the intracellular domain of the receptors (phosphorylation). The phosphorylated residues can then transmit the signal to the next messenger within the cytoplasm.</para><note id="eip-488"><label/><para id="fs-id2336899"><figure id="fig-ch09_01_07"><media id="fs-id1512186" alt="This illustration shows two receptor tyrosine kinase monomers embedded in the plasma membrane.
