  <md:title>Preface</md:title>
  <md:abstract>Human Anatomy and Physiology is designed for the two-semester anatomy and physiology course taken by life science and allied health students.  The textbook follows the scope and sequence of most Human Anatomy and Physiology courses, and its coverage and organization were informed by hundreds of instructors who teach the course.  Instructors can customize the book, adapting it to the approach that works best in their classroom.  
The artwork for this textbook is aimed focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.   Color is used sparingly, to emphasize the most important aspects of any given illustration.  Significant use of micrographs from the University of Michigan complement the illustrations, and provide the students with a meaningful alternate depiction of each concept.  Finally, enrichment elements provide relevance and deeper context for students, particularly in the areas of health, disease, and information relevant to their intended careers.</md:abstract>

  <para id="delete_me">Welcome to <emphasis effect="italics">Anatomy and Physiology with Concept Coach</emphasis>, an OpenStax resource. We created this textbook with several goals in mind: accessibility, customization, and student engagement—helping students reach high levels of academic scholarship. Instructors and students alike will find that this textbook offers a thorough introduction to the content in an accessible format. In this web view version of the book, students will find Concept Coach questions at the end of most non-introductory sections.  Additional homework questions, if needed, are accessible via the PDF (under "Downloads" at the bottom of this page).</para><section id="eip-7"><title>About OpenStax</title><para id="eip-463">
OpenStax is a nonprofit organization committed to improving student access to quality learning materials. Our free textbooks are developed and peer-reviewed by educators to ensure that they are readable, accurate, and organized in accordance with the scope and sequence requirements of today’s college courses. Unlike traditional textbooks, OpenStax resources live online and are owned by the community of educators using them. Through partnerships with companies and foundations committed to reducing costs for students, we are working to improve access to higher education for all. OpenStax is an initiative of Rice University and is made possible through the generous support of several philanthropic foundations.
</para></section><section id="eip-987"><title>About Concept Coach</title><para id="eip-518">
Thanks to a generous courseware grant, OpenStax is developing a new, free tool to increase reading comprehension.  This free tool, called Concept Coach, will be embedded in the web view of OpenStax’s college textbooks. As students read, they will be asked questions to reinforce their understanding of the content. Concept Coach automatically incorporates proven cognitive science principles — spaced practice, retrieval practice, and feedback — to increase students' long-term retention. Concept Coach is designed to easily integrate into a professor's existing workflow and is not a replacement for traditional or online homework.</para>

<para id="eip-id1168762091068">At the end of each non-introductory section of the chapter, students will find Concept Coach questions.  Additional homework questions, if needed, are accessible via the PDF (under "Downloads" at the bottom of this page).
</para></section><section id="eip-374"><title>About OpenStax's Resources</title><para id="eip-0">
OpenStax resources provide quality academic instruction. Three key features set our materials apart from others: 1) They can be easily customized by instructors for each class, 2) they are “living” resources that grow online through contributions from science educators, and 3) they are available for free or for a minimal cost.
</para><section id="eip-262"><title>Customization</title><para id="eip-362">
OpenStax learning resources are conceived and written with flexibility in mind so that they can be customized for each course. Our textbooks provide a solid foundation on which instructors can build their own texts. Instructors can select the sections that are most relevant to their curricula and create a textbook that speaks directly to the needs of their students. Instructors are encouraged to expand on existing examples in the text by adding unique context via geographically localized applications and topical connections.

Our unique approach to visuals is designed to emphasize only the components most important in any given illustration. The art style is particularly aimed at focusing student learning through a powerful blend of traditional depictions and instructional innovations.  
</para>
<para id="eip-id1167703115240">Much of the art in this book consists of black line illustrations. The strongest line is used to highlight the most important structures, and shading is used to show dimension and shape. Color is used sparingly to highlight and clarify the primary anatomical or functional point of the illustration. This technique is intended to draw students’ attention to the critical learning point in the illustration, without distraction from excessive gradients, shadows, and highlights. Full color is used when the structure or process requires it (for example, muscle diagrams and cardiovascular system illustrations).
